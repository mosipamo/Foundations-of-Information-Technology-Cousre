# Foundations-of-Information-Technology-Course

## HW1:
- Draw a Gartner hype cycle for a technology(It can be anything). Keep the time frames and just show what stages it has.
In this homework, we are assigned to draw a Gartner hype cycle for a technology. I chose MP3 players!

## HW2:
- How can we determine the parameter $ \beta $ (beta) based on different factors and report its value?
In this homework, we should model $ \beta $ in terms of different factors. we can consider some factors related to the sender, the receiver, and the events occuring during transmission.
Here are some formulas:

$$ H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i) $$

$$ H_{\text{effective}}(X) = -\beta \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i) $$

$$ \Delta H = H_{\text{receiver}} - H_{\text{sender}} $$
